/**
 * @mainpage API reference of the MineSweeperMatrix library version 2
 *
 * The MineSweeperMatrix library (called libmsm) is able to save you a lot of
 * time in the daily task of implementing a MineSweeper game ;).\n
 *
 * But seriously, this one of my training projects. Originally, I've developed
 * the game logic used in this library for a MineSweeper implementation I've
 * built while my studies in 2011. This first version of the game used GTKmm
 * for the GUI.\n
 * Later, I would like to become acquainted with Qt and decided to use again
 * MineSweeper as training project. To not implement the logic again, the first
 * version of this library was extracted from the first game.\n
 * This is a rework of that library I've made at the end of 2012 for an Android
 * implementation of (you guessed it) MineSweeper.\n
 *
 * In 2014 I've decided to make this project open-source. Maybe the code is useful
 * for anyone. The implementation covers some basic topics of (C++) programming like:
 * - Observer pattern
 * - Implementation hiding with the pimpl idiom
 * - Advanced subscript operator overloading ([][])
 * - Exceptions
 * - boost::signals2 (optionally activatable)
 * - const correctness (I guess)
 * - boost::test
 *
 * If you find some bugs, anti-pattern or anything you like to indicate, please
 * write me an E-Mail or contribute to the project at GitHub.
